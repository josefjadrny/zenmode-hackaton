# Zenmode hackaton
This project proves some ai scenarios for Pipedrive's internal hackathon. It uses openai API and all data here (emails and templates) were generated by me.

If you want to play with it, clone this repository, install all packages with `npm i`, create `.env` file in the root folder with content like `OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"` and start it with `npm run start`.

You can generate your api key [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
